    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <p>I've ve been making indie games and prototypes non-stop since 2011. First with the Construct 2 engine and later with the Unreal Engine since 2015.<br>
    I have 7+ years of experience with the Unreal Engine 4, and about 1+ with the Unreal Engine 5.<br><br>
        
    Between 2017 and 2019 worked as a freelance gemeplay programmer and technical artist.<br><br>
    
    Since January 2020 I've been working as a Sr Technical Artist at Globant (AAA Contractor); there I've been working since the very start on <b>WB-Avalanche's "Hogwarts Legacy"</b>. Where I've worked on Tools, Systems, and Content Optimization:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>[Editor Tool, Python, C++, Blueprints]</b> Wrote several automated Python Script to set up foliage and collision properties, among others.</li>
        <li><b>[Editor Tool, C++, Blueprints]</b> Created smart and lightweight Spline-Based Tool to place collisions on the world (The Main collision tool used throughout the game by Artists and Level Designers).</li>
        <li><b>[Editor Tool, C++, Blueprints]</b> Created Automated process to setup and create Mesh Proxies to use in World Composition LOD maps. This tool and its Mesh proxies are how the game handles all the geometry on LOD maps. It is necessary in order to maintain a high quality on Proxies due to sheer size and complexity of level geometry. The tool also uses a Widget Blueprint as its main control interface for setup in the Editor.</li>
        <li><b>[Gameplay System, C++, Blueprints]</b> Wrote a runtime system that dynamically populates the world with lightweight impostor trees outside the player near radius. This allows the world to remain fully populated with trees at a lower cost compared to traditional UE4 pipelines.</li>
        <li><b>[Editor Tool, Blueprints]</b> Created and supported multiple other smart and configurable spline based tools for mesh actors; such as low walls and fences used throughout the open world.</li>
        <li><b>[Teaching, Support]</b> Besides my own tasks, I also regularly helped the teams at Globant, Avalanche, and other Studios within the project with UE4 scripts and general usability questions.</li>
    </ul>
