    <h2>MESH WALL TOOL (USED IN HOGWARTS LEGACY)</h2>
    <p>A seemengli normal spline mesh tool, with the unique feature of only using Spline Mesh Components where they are actually necesary, everywhere else it will try to use Instanced Static Mesh Components,
         unless there is only 1 instance, in which case it will use a regular Static Mesh for that section.</p>
    <p>It has other features, should as letting you pick a specific Star and/or End mesh, to add pillars in between each section. Or pillars as start/end meshes.</p>

            <p>Only the sections that actually have enough curvature will use Spline Mesh, all the other are Instanced Static mesh.</p>

    <h2>SIMPLIFIED COLLISION TOOL (USED IN HOGWARTS LEGACY)</h2>
    <p>A Spline-Based simplified collision tool. I originally created a simpler version of it for my game Bandits, but suggested to the Hogwarts Legacy guys they needed it something like it.
        So I created this advanced version for that game.</p>
    <p>The tool is a single InstancedStaticMeshComponent with a clean box mesh, scaled to fit each segment.</p>
    <div id="Section">
        <div id="Element">
            <iframe id="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uDNzwDHcqkI?si=pvrwrLBc4pUOt8aO" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>The tool is quite cheap to process, and even though it shouldn't really need to be too long, it can and it barely hitches the editor.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/SimplifiedCollision/CollisionPanel.png" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>(Open in new tab to see properly) The tool is C++ based, so I could expose the InstancedStaticMeshComponent Collision properties directly to the Actor details panel.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/SimplifiedCollision/A.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>The wall acounts for the spline courve to only generate new instances/sections where the delta rotation has exceded the max allowed delta (configurable parameter).</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/SimplifiedCollision/B.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>Here you can see clearly each section that was created in this case.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/SimplifiedCollision/C.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>The wall can also be configured to handle pitch rotation, in case you needed to add colission on a cavern or stairs.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/SimplifiedCollision/D.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>One super neat feature of the wall is how the instances/segments always allign perfeclty on the outside corner, so there is no gap or space to get snaged by. Prised be the math.</p>

    <h2>NETWORKED INVENTORY - ONLINE RPG PROTOTYPE</h2>
    <p>The essentials for an Online RPG; can equip things, can put things in containers, can put things on your inventory, and so on. Everything is properly replicated through Unreal's networking system. 
        <br>Server always has authority over all transactions.</p>

            <p>The video shows a listen-server and a client interacting with the networked inventory/ui system, and behavior is consistent on both ends.</p>

    <h2>HOGWARTS LEGACY - PROXY TOOL </h2>
    <p>In this game the level were built in many sublevels used as layers, which made HLODs not a viable option. So I created a system that would use a SetupMap to load all the levels used on a buildings
        and capture a snapshot of it to generate a Proxy from, that included everything. This also suported the Winter variation that was covered in snow. At the end ProxyContainerActor was played on the LOD
        level automatically. We created a TeamCity job for this, that would run constantly, so any work artist did on any level would be shortly reflected on the LOD Proxies.
    </p>
    <div id="Section">
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/HarvestGeometryActor/01.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>Each building we wanted a proxy of, needed to have a setup on one of the setup maps. There you would place a volume and configure it through a handy Utility Widget.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/HarvestGeometryActor/02.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>The result was a proxy of all the sections that had impostors such as windows, vines, and small detail. A regular Proxy, and a Winter version. In the end these would all be assembled back in the
                 ProxyContainerActor that gets placed in the LOD map.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/HarvestGeometryActor/03.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>Here is the proxy with only the flat stuff, which has an extremely low poly count.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/HarvestGeometryActor/04.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>This is the proxy, that does not bake any of the meshes that had impostors in them. This saved an tremendous amount of triangles, and would actually help with the silouete. At the end both
                meshes are assembled in the ProxyContainerActor and looks like a normal proxy with all its elements. 
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>The system also extended to the Landscape LODs, which used the same ProxyTool, but unbound, to generate a proxy of all the actors and meshes on the tile. There it performed specific steps for big rocks,
         hills, long spline tools, roads, and so on.<br>
         Everything combined was quite literally everything outside of the player nearby readius, including the entire Hogsmeade Town and the Hogwarts Castle, which was quite a lot of work to get right!</p>

    <h2>HOGWARTS LEGACY - FAR FOLIAGE</h2>
    <p>A UE4 World Composition optimization that handles the far away foliage without ugly Tile LOD proxies. Also good to hide level streaming pops, as this system functions independently of it.
        As you move around the system updated which far foliage instances are rendered.
    </p>
    <div id="Section">
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/FarFoliage/01.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>1st step was to capture all the big-enough overworld foliage and store them in a pre-computed list. We created a TeamCity job that would do this step daily, so any work artists did would be 
                reflected on the farfoliage not long after.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/FarFoliage/02.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>At runtime there is a radius around the player, here represented by a big sphere, and outside of it normal Foliage is no longer rendered, as the foliage max-draw distance was set
                 to match the radius of the far foliage system.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/FarFoliage/03.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>Here I've selected the normal foliage, and everything beyond the sphere is Far Foliage, which is a collection of Impostors.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <p>As you move around, the run-time system evaluates which far foliage to render, while the regular foliage just uses the native foliage optimization of Unreal and fades out foliage
                 after a specified max-draw distance. <br>
                Aditionally the system has other optimizations, such as only evaluating after you've moved enough, that the tiles are inside the view frustrum, and that they are close enough to be updated.</p>
            <p>Should try to get a video of this working in-game...</p>

    <h2>RPG SIMPLE DIALOGUE SYSTEM AND SETUP</h2>
    <p>The dialogue system has all you need without reinventing the wheel. It just uses Blueprints, and 4 custom C++ Nodes to handle everything. It supports regular lines, questions, branching dialogue, a fallback concluded state, interaction with the world, etc.</p>
    <div id="Section">
        <div id="Element">

            <img src="images/portfolio/DialogueSystem/Nodes.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>The first pair of nodes are Latent Blueprint nodes, they start and won't Complete until they get their callback. The second pair are so you can print the lines however way you want. 
                And the last two are the callbacks to let the Latent Nodes know they can now Complete.</p>

        <div id="Element">

            <p>Inheriting from a Parent class that handles all the nuance, child blueprints only need to worry about their scripted dialogue.</p>

        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/DialogueSystem//Actor.PNG" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">

    <h2>GRID MATERIAL</h2>
    <p>Very useful for prototypes or low poly games. Its a material that lets you use a Material Instance to pick the color of each one of its 16 sections.</p>

        <div id="Element">
            <img src="images/portfolio/ColorGrid/A.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">
            <p>The Matereial splits the UV into 16 sections and asignes a color to each one. It would be extended to also include other things if the project needed it.</p>
