    <h2>SIMPLIFIED COLLISION TOOL</h2>
    <p>A spline-based simplified collision tool. I initially designed a simpler version for my game "Bandits." Later, I suggested a similar tool to the "Hogwarts Legacy" team and developed this advanced version for them.</p>
    <p>The tool uses a single InstancedStaticMeshComponent with a 8-verts box mesh, scaled for each segment.</p>
    <div id="Section">
        <div id="Element">
            <p>It's efficient to process. While it's designed not to be overly lengthy, it can be, without causing noticeable hitches in the editor.</p>

        <div id="Element">
            <p>This tool is built in C++, allowing me to directly expose the InstancedStaticMeshComponent Collision properties to the Actor details panel.</p>

            <p>The wall adjusts to the spline curve, generating new instances/sections only when the delta rotation surpasses the set maximum delta, which is a configurable parameter.</p>

        <div id="Element">
            <p>A key feature of the wall is how the instances/segments align perfectly on the outside corner, ensuring no gaps or spaces where one could get snagged. All thanks to the math behind it.</p>

    <h2>MESH WALL TOOL (USED IN HOGWARTS LEGACY)</h2>
    <p>This tool may seem like a typical spline mesh tool, but it uniquely uses Spline Mesh Components only where necessary. Otherwise, it opts for Instanced Static Mesh Components, or a single regular Static Mesh for single instances.</p>
    <p>The tool offers additional features, such as selecting specific Start and/or End meshes, to place pillars between each section, or using pillars as start/end meshes.</p>

    <h2>HOGWARTS LEGACY - PROXY TOOL </h2>
    <p>In "Hogwarts Legacy", levels were constructed using multiple sublevels as layers. This approach rendered HLODs unsuitable. To address this, I developed a system that would utilize a custom SetupMap to load all the sublevels associated with a building or structure. The system would then capture a comprehensive snapshot to produce a Proxy, inclusive of all relevant elements. This mechanism was also equipped to accommodate the snowy winter variation. Eventually, a ProxyContainerActor would be automatically generated in the LOD level. We also created a weekly TeamCity job to ensure that any modifications artists made to any level would soon be mirrored in the LOD Proxies.</p>
    <div id="Section">
        <div id="Element">
            <p>For each building requiring a proxy, a configuration was established within the setup maps. Here, a volume was placed and adjusted via a convenient Utility Widget.</p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/HarvestGeometryActor/01.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">            
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <p>The process output 3 meshes, one for things that had a last-lod impostor; like windows, vines, and finer details. And 2 other proxies; a default one and a winter variant. Ultimately, these proxies were combined within the ProxyContainerActor positioned in the LOD map.</p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/HarvestGeometryActor/02.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">            
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <p>This showcases the proxy containing only flat components, which significantly reduces the total polygon count.</p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/HarvestGeometryActor/03.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">            
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <p>This version of the proxy omits any mesh that had impostors. This exclusion drastically cuts down on triangle counts, aiding silhouette rendering. In the final rendition, both versions merge within the ProxyContainerActor, presenting a complete proxy with all its components.</p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/HarvestGeometryActor/04.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">            
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <p>The system was also adapted for World Composition Landscape LODs. Leveraging the same ProxyTool, but Unbound; it could generate a proxy for all actors and meshes on a given tile. Specific steps were executed for larger rock formations, hills, long spline tools, roads, etc. Collectively, this encompassed everything beyond the immediate vicinity of the player, including the very large and complex Hogsmeade Town and Hogwarts Castle.</p>

    <h2>HOGWARTS LEGACY - FAR FOLIAGE</h2>
    <p>A UE4 World Composition optimization that manages the distant foliage without creating foliage mesh proxies, the FarFoliage system exists as a distinct layer on top of the World Composition Tile environment. This arrangement allows it to manage all foliage-related elements, as World Composition Tile LODs do not include any foliage. The system also helps mask level streaming pops, as it operates independently. As players move, the system updates which distant foliage instances are displayed.</p>
    <div id="Section">
        <div id="Element">
            <p>The first step was to identify all the relevant overworld foliage and store that information in a pre-computed list. We established a TeamCity job to carry out this step daily. This ensured that any modifications made by artists would be reflected in the distant foliage shortly after.<br><br>
                The image below is a snapshot of the entire overworld. The boxes indicate the bounds of the captured foliage per tile.</p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/FarFoliage/01.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">            
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <p>At runtime, there's a defined radius around the player, represented here by a large sphere. Beyond this sphere, normal foliage isn't rendered since the foliage's max-draw distance is set to align with the distant foliage system's radius.</p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/FarFoliage/02.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">            
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <p>In this image, I've highlighted the regular foliage. Outside the radius, all foliage is represented by impostors. Importantly, these impostors are used per tree type or family, rather than for each individual or unique tree mesh.</p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/Phx/FarFoliage/03.jpg" title="Right click and open in new tab to see larger.">            
        </div>
        <div id="Element">
            <p>As players move, the runtime system determines which distant foliage should be displayed. Meanwhile, the standard foliage utilizes Unreal's native optimization, fading out foliage beyond a set max-draw distance. Additionally, the system includes other enhancements, such as evaluating only after significant player movement, ensuring tiles are within the viewing frustum, and verifying they are not too far to be relevant at the time.</p>
            <p>I might try to capture a video of this in action in-game...</p>

    <h2>RPG SIMPLE DIALOGUE SYSTEM AND SETUP</h2>
    <p>The dialogue system offers essential features without overcomplication. Utilizing Blueprints and 6 custom C++ nodes, it supports standard dialogues, branching conversations, questions, a default concluded state, and interactive world elements.</p>

            <p>Within the game, the dialogue system can be seen in action. Towards the end, the player requests an NPC to unlock a door.</p>

        <div id="Element">
            <p>The system integrates six nodes. The first two are Latent Blueprint nodes which only complete once they receive their callback. The next two facilitate custom line displays, and the final pair are callbacks indicating the Latent Nodes can proceed.</p>

        <div id="Element">
            <p>Here's an example of how the blueprint dialogue script is built. Except for the custom Request line/question nodes, everything is vanilla Blueprints. the 'DoDialogue Event' is when dialogue is first initiated through the NPC host, and the 'DoFallback Event' is used instead when the primary dialogue has already been "used". Doing this is optional.</p>

        <div id="Element">
            <p>This other example showcases a script built around a question, with the initial line being alternated when the player replies with the D option. Since this is all Blueprints, any type of script customization can be easily achieved.</p>
